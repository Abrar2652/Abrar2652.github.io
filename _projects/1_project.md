This project develops AI-driven methods to automatically extract and interpret complex geochemistry data from scientific literature, enabling the creation of a global database of trace and byproduct mineral concentrations. The system integrates semantic table understanding, knowledge graph construction, and human-in-the-loop curation to support mineral prospectivity mapping and critical mineral assessments.
