This project develops a secure, scalable knowledge graph platform for defense supply chain analytics. It integrates blockchain-based data provenance and fine-grained access control with automated semantic data ingestion, enabling the Air Force to unify and analyze complex, multi-tier logistics data. The system supports predictive analytics, ensures data integrity, and aligns with Zero Trust security principles, with future deployment planned within the Earth 616 ecosystem.
