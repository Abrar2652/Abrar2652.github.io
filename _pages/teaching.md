#### Research Mentor
In addition to conducting individual research, I mentor enthusiastic students from three top Bangladeshi universities: KUET, AIUB, and SUST. Most of these students are in their 3rd and 4th years of study. My role involves teaching them scientific research methodology, article writing, research ethics, and journal formatting. I also help them acquire funding to support their research endeavors. I am proud to have mentored two talented undergraduate admission aspirants in the USA, one of whom has already been admitted with a fully-funded scholarship.

_Current Students_:
* Taufikur Rahman Fuad (IUT EEE)
* Saleh Akram Naife (KUET IEM)
