**Problem Solving:**
I enjoy training my problem solving skills through daily problem solving brain games on [Lumosity](https://www.lumosity.com/en/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I used to take part in competitive programming contests like Codeforces, Google Kickstart, and Google HashCode.


**Contribution as a Peer Reviewer:**
I actively serve as a referee for esteemed Q1/Q2 journals and CORE ranked conferences and provide constructive feedback to support the advancement of knowledge in AI/ML systems. Check out my peer review recognition by Web of Science [here](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AFE-0313-2022 "WoS Profile"){:target="_blank"}.


**Hackathons:**
Participating in ML hackathons and business competitions was a turning point in my journey, gradually teaching me to question conventional dogma and leading me toward academic research. I'm amazed by the process of collaborating with individuals from diverse cultures and backgrounds. As a team, we come together to tackle real-world challenges through innovative machine learning solutions. I participate in hackathons hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mdabrarjahin "mdabrarjahin"){:target="_blank"}, [Devpost](https://devpost.com/abrar-jahin-2652 "abrar-jahin-2652"){:target="_blank"}, and [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/users/Abrar2652/ "Abrar2652"){:target="_blank"}.
All of my business case solutions from my undergraduate years are available on [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/MdAbrarJahin){:target="_blank"}. In April 2024, as the _Founder & AI Researcher_ of *SpecX*, I submitted our solution for the **MIT Solve Challenge 2024**. You can find our solution [here](https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/2024-global-health-challenge/solutions/90695){:target="_blank"}.


**Lead Guitar:**
I have a profound passion for playing the lead guitar. My musical journey began with the acoustic guitar in class 8, and over time, I grew deeply attached to the genres of *progressive rock*, *heavy metal*, *classical rock*, and *alternative rock* with my custom lead guitar in class 10. During my college and university years, I performed on various occasions and even taught lead guitar to juniors who shared the same interest. Along with four friends from cadet college, I formed the band *[Oporanho](https://www.facebook.com/oporanho.rockz){:target="_blank"}* while at MCC. Together, we created lasting memories performing at cultural nights, campfires, and excursions. After 2021, I stepped away from music for personal reasons, even selling my first acoustic guitar, though my love for it has never faded. Music still remains an abstract language for me, an outlet to express emotions when words fall short, a bridge even during moments of silence or conflict. In the end, I couldn’t resist returning: practicing again, chasing the speed and emotion that first made me fall in love with the guitar. To keep my passion alive, I maintain a personal [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrdkiCJ3yxAOqFmJfb7RUWA){:target="_blank"} where I share guitar covers, self-composed instrumentals, and musical explorations.

**Painting:**
In the past, I enjoyed occasional ventures into painting, particularly abstract pieces created with watercolors. I participated in Inter House Painting Competitions and contributed to the Wall Magazine Competition in my college days (2012-2018), involving various art and literary content. During this time, I also guided others in painting projects, helping to design and execute artistic contributions for various events.
