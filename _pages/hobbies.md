**Problem Solving:**
I find immense pleasure in honing my problem-solving skills through daily sessions of [Lumosity](https://www.lumosity.com/en/){:target="_blank"} brain games. These researcher-designed games challenge and improve my short-term memory, working memory, information processing speed, cognitive function, and fluid reasoning. Additionally, I used to participate in competitive programming contests such as Codeforces, Google Kickstart, and Google HashCode.


**Online Learning and Continuing Education:**
My thirst for knowledge in my research domain drives me to engage in continuous learning. I regularly follow online blogs such as *Towards Data Science*, *Medium*, and *Kaggle Notebooks*, and stay updated with the latest state-of-the-art research on *ResearchGate*. Additionally, I take courses on platforms like *DataCamp*, *edX*, and *Coursera*. This commitment to ongoing education helps me stay current and competitive with the latest research trends in my field. My online course certificates are showcased on my LinkedIn profile.


**Contribution as a Peer Reviewer:**
I actively contribute to the academic community as a referee for esteemed Q1 journals. My commitment to reviewing scholarly work allows me to play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and rigor of research publications. By providing constructive feedback and insightful evaluations, I contribute to the advancement of knowledge within my field. Check out my peer review recognition by Web of Science [here](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AFE-0313-2022 "WoS Profile"){:target="_blank"}.


**Hackathons:**
Participating in ML hackathons and business competitions is an exhilarating experience for me. Collaborating with individuals from diverse cultures and interests, we come together as a team to tackle real-world challenges through innovative machine learning solutions. I actively participate in hackathons hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mdabrarjahin "mdabrarjahin"){:target="_blank"}, [Devpost](https://devpost.com/abrar-jahin-2652 "abrar-jahin-2652"){:target="_blank"}, and [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/users/Abrar2652/ "Abrar2652"){:target="_blank"}.
All of my business case solutions from my undergraduate years are available on [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/MdAbrarJahin){:target="_blank"}. In April 2024, as the _Founder & AI Researcher_ of *SpecX*, I submitted our solution for the **MIT Solve Challenge 2024**. You can find our solution [here](https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/2024-global-health-challenge/solutions/90695){:target="_blank"}.


**Lead Guitar:**
Another passion of mine is playing lead guitar. My musical journey began with acoustic guitar in class 8, and I gradually immersed myself in the enchanting world of *progressive rock, heavy metal, and alternative-rock* genres. I've performed on various college and university stages, showcasing my love for music. Additionally, I used to teach lead guitar to fellow students during my college days, sharing techniques, tips, and my love for the instrument. To express my passion for lead guitar, I have a personal [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrdkiCJ3yxAOqFmJfb7RUWA){:target="_blank"}, where I share my guitar covers and musical explorations.

**Painting:**
In the past, I enjoyed occasional ventures into painting, particularly abstract pieces created with watercolors. I participated in Inter House Painting Competitions and contributed to the Wall Magazine Competition in my college days (2012-2018), involving various art and literary content. During this time, I also guided others in painting projects, helping to design and execute artistic contributions for various events.
