This is *Md Abrar Jahin, CSCA<sup>&trade;</sup>*; however, you can call me *Abrar*. 

I am a 1st-year **CS PhD student** at the [Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science, Viterbi School of Engineering](https://www.cs.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"}, **[University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"}**. I am affiliated with the *[Center on Knowledge Graphs](https://www.isi.edu/centers-ckg/){:target="_blank"}* at the **[Information Sciences Institute (ISI)](https://www.isi.edu/){:target="_blank"}**, located at the heart of Silicon Beach. I am fortunate to be co-advised by **[Prof. Craig Knoblock](https://www.isi.edu/people-knoblock/){:target="_blank"}** and **[Prof. Jay Pujara](https://www.isi.edu/directory/jpujara/){:target="_blank"}**. My research at ISI is generously supported by the **Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)**, a US Department of Defense agency. I have also been awarded the prestigious **Viterbi Graduate School Fellowship** (2025-2026) in recognition of my outstanding academic promise.

Before joining USC, I obtained my B.Sc. in Industrial & Production Engineering (IPE) in March 2024 from the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management at [Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET)](https://www.kuet.ac.bd/){:target="_blank"}.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of **efficient deep learning**, **quantum machine learning**, **geometric deep learning**, and **trustworthy AI**. My previous research includes **reinforcement learning**, **sentiment analysis**, **operations research**, and **comparative genomics**. I conceptualize and develop methods to solve complex problems either by hybridizing different techniques or by adopting ideas from seemingly unrelated fields to create novel, interdisciplinary solutions. My background in IPE and extensive research experience in comparative genomics help me approach challenging issues in machine learning from a uniquely interdisciplinary perspective. This distinctive lens allows me to conceptualize and implement efficient, unorthodox strategies beyond traditional machine learning frameworks.

## Early Research Achievements

From my first year of university (2019), I started learning C/C++ and Python for problem-solving while maintaining strong academic performance. I participated in international competitions like IYMC (2019) and IAAC (2020), where I tackled challenging research-level problems. My first success on the international stage came from solving these problems using my own algorithms. This experience boosted my confidence and helped me realize my passion for research, leading me to pursue a career in AI. Since then, I haven’t looked back. I see learning as a lifelong journey. I deeply believe in the value of knowledge—its loyalty, its depth, and its power to endure over time.

I feel fortunate to have been the first Bangladeshi undergraduate student to receive the opportunity for two international research internships in the same year.  After leading my team to win the ["Smart Roads – Winter Road Maintenance Hackathon 2021"](https://dit4bears.devpost.com/project-gallery){:target="_blank"}, I was offered a 3-week Machine Learning research internship at [UiT - The Arctic University of Norway](https://en.uit.no/){:target="_blank"}. During this internship, I contributed to the [DIT4BEARs Smart Roads project](http://dit4bears.org/){:target="_blank"}.

I was honored to receive a **fully-funded scholarship** as the first Bangladeshi **Research Intern (RI)** (October 2021) at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST)](https://www.oist.jp/){:target="_blank"}. Under the supervision of **[Prof. Jonathan Miller](https://groups.oist.jp/pbu/jonathan-miller){:target="_blank"}** (PhD in Biology, Cambridge; PhD in Physics, Caltech), I conducted research on perfectly conserved sequences in humans and other species in the *Physics and Biology Unit (Miller Unit)*. Thanks to this early experience, I was fortunate to be offered another opportunity in 2023 as a **Visiting Research Student (VRS)** at OIST. After graduating in March 2024, I continued collaborating as a **Visiting Researcher (VR)** until March 2025, working closely with Prof. Miller as well as [Dr. Zifcakova](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lucia-Zifcakova){:target="_blank"}, [Dr. Biller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WcCd_BoAAAAJ&hl=it){:target="_blank"}, [Dr. Lajbner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9R_ewDcAAAAJ){:target="_blank"}, and [Dr. Pnini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RVC1fEsAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} on the evolutionary dynamics of strongly conserved sequences in vertebrates and insects.

I had the privilege of being co-supervised by **[Prof. M. F. Mridha](https://www.aiub.edu/faculty-list/faculty-profile#firoz.mridha@aiub.edu){:target="_blank"}**, **[Prof. Nilanjan Dey](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=uZmrRHAAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}**, **[Prof. Md. Saiful Islam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PsHZ75wAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}**, and **[Dr. Mohammad Arafat Hussain](https://marafathussain.github.io/){:target="_blank"}** (Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard Medical School) during my undergraduate studies and early research career. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with distinguished computer scientists, including **[Prof. R. Simon Sherratt](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=FmTl_5UAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}** (IEEE Fellow), **[Prof. Jungpil Shin](https://u-aizu.ac.jp/labs/is-pp/pplab/shin.html){:target="_blank"}**, **[Prof. Yuichi Okuyama](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K8i6uGkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}**, **[Prof. Zeyar Aung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FPTI7B4AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}**, **[Prof. Yutaka Watanobe](https://u-aizu.ac.jp/~yutaka/){:target="_blank"}**, **[Prof. Md. Rashedul Islam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=V-HK1CEAAAAJ){:target="_blank"}**, and **[Prof. Md. Jakir Hossen](https://mmuexpert.mmu.edu.my/jakirhossen){:target="_blank"}**.

I am the first undergraduate in Bangladesh whose thesis focused on Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and achieved remarkable success by being published in Nature Scientific Reports, setting several new records:

* First instance of any thesis from KUET accepted by a 'Nature Portfolio' journal 5-6 months before the graduation of any student.
* First instance of any article or thesis from my department (KUET IEM) being published in a 'Nature Portfolio' journal, irrespective of student or faculty status.
* First successful research related to 'Quantum Computing' published from KUET.
* First work on the application of Explainable Quantum Machine Learning in the Supply Chain Management domain.

I received an encouraging email in 2023 from **[Professor Junyu Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/junyuliu/main){:target="_blank"}** (Assistant Professor, Department of CS, University of Pittsburgh), a renowned quantum information and machine learning scientist. Professor Liu was impressed by my undergraduate thesis, which he came across on arXiv preprint while it was under review.

## My Personal Perspectives about Life in Academia

I firmly believe that being a researcher is not just a career but a way of life that demands perseverance, intellectual curiosity, and commitment to advancing knowledge. Under the supervision of Professor Jonathan Miller at OIST, I had the privilege of conducting PhD-level computational research while balancing the demands of my undergraduate studies. During this time, I observed the pressures of the publish-or-perish culture in academia but remained committed to conducting meaningful and ethical research. Under his guidance, I gained invaluable insights into how groundbreaking science is conducted, no matter how long the process might take. Professor Miller's mentorship profoundly shaped my research approach, and being part of his lab was a transformative moment when his colleague, **[Professor Svante Pääbo](https://www.oist.jp/research/svante-paabo){:target="_blank"}**, won the **Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine** (2022). The research I was pursuing at that time closely aligned with Professor Pääbo’s work, reinforcing my confidence in the potential impact of my efforts and elevating my aspirations to new heights.


My experiences in academic research over past couple of years since 2021 has strengthened my belief that academia is the place where I belong. I am fascinated by the ethics, honesty and rigor that academia represents. Compared to the outcomes which are more apparent in industry, academia forces researchers to face these uncertainties and solve problems with much more harder questions over much longer timescales. Overcoming smaller technical challenges (which are still not easy) in academia has given me the greatest satisfaction and inspired me to pursue academic research. I am eager to join in a highly competitive environment and push myself out of my comfort zone, because I am peer-pressure-driven and consider this as a motivation.

My philosophy of success is simple: I seek out individuals smarter than myself, collaborate with them, and learn from their expertise. My leadership experiences have taught me that while I cannot excel in every domain, I can bring brilliant minds together to achieve impactful solutions for the greater good of science and humanity. Throughout my academic journey, I have combined technical expertise, research experience, and interpersonal skills to accomplish ambitious goals that often seemed beyond reach.

## Childhood Education and Academic Achievements

My educational journey has been profoundly influenced by my experiences at [Mirzapur Cadet College](https://mcc.army.mil.bd/){:target="_blank"} and [Bogra Zilla School (BZS)](http://bograzillaschool.edu.bd/){:target="_blank"}. These institutions have played a pivotal role in shaping my character and academic success. Through these formative years, I acquired essential qualities such as perseverance, stepping out of my comfort zone, taking responsibilities, and the determination to overcome challenges. I also learned the value of selfless friendship, leadership, and the importance of following a chain of command. Moreover, I developed skills in extempore speech, time management, decision-making, and task prioritization.

My academic achievements were recognized through Government Board Scholarships in PSC (2006), JSC (2013), SSC (2016), and HSC (2018) exams. Notably, I secured the 17th position in the Rajshahi Board in the PSC exams.

During my time at BZS for primary education, I excelled in a highly competitive academic setting, consistently achieving top ranks in annual academic assessments. I actively participated in various quiz competitions, securing victories in three competitions organized by renowned entities such as the United Nations and Kishore Kantho. Additionally, I organized a quiz competition on a rolling basis, engaging students in subjects like primary-level Olympiad maths, English, and general knowledge (both national and international categories). This initiative not only kept students involved but also generated revenue, with each set of quiz questions priced at 2 Taka and a grand prize of a video game DVD (FIFA 2010), resulting in approximately 500 Tk in revenue during 2010-2011. These experiences have significantly influenced my academic journey, fostering a deep-seated passion for continuous learning and personal growth.
