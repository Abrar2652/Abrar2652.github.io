Thanks to NSU YES! (Young Entrepreneurs Society) for having me as a judge for Round 1 (Envision) of Entrepret Season 3, the flagship entrepreneurial challenge. It was especially meaningful to return in this role, as my own team ranked among the top 6 out of 380+ teams in Season 2 (2021). I thoroughly enjoyed evaluating ten outstanding business pitches, and selecting only the top two was both challenging and rewarding.
