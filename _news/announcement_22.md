USC CS Department informed me of my recommended admission to the PhD program and invited me to attend the PhD Visit Days on March 6â€“7, 2025, in Los Angeles. The two-day event includes meetings with faculty, current students, and department leadership, along with tours of the new Ginsburg Human-Centered Computation Hall and affiliated research centers such as ISI and ICT.
