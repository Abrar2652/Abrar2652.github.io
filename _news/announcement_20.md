My PhD SOP and PS have been approved and published on the [cs-sop](https://cs-sop.notion.site/e329db29d825467e84f23a00dcaced54?v=25643eb6365a420d87c2f44cffdaa98b&p=1cc8b1bdf3c48045b424f7f61eff9321&pm=c){:target="_blank"} website, where you will get to know how I cracked the top schools considering the brutal funding conditions and in a competitive domain like CS-AI/ML Systems in Fall 2025, despite coming from a non-CS (IPE) background.
