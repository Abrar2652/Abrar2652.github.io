â€‹Our article, "Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network for High-Energy Physics," [[Full Text](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10938398){:target="_blank"}] has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (TAI). This marks the first Transactions article for our AMIR lab. My co-supervisors are extremely delighted with this remarkable achievement.
