Thanks to Tithi Krittania for the unbelievable amount of time and patience she had allocated to take my interview; thanks to Md Arif Hasan, the founder of Beyond Stories and Short Stories, for the valuable offer to share my journey and short biography leading towards PhD acceptance at USC, in front of the nation. My deep appreciation goes to Shamsul Alam Rupon for this outstanding and thoughtful portrait editing, keeping my headshot in front of the famous Bovard Auditorium (USC).
